* The length of the contract is key factor in churn prediction. Customers who have monthly contracts are more likely to switch to other providers. Churn rate seems to be higher for lower account length. (Inverse correlation)
* The main churn reason is "Competitor made better offer".
* Customers who do not have partners seem to churn way more than those who do.
